## Introduction
India is home to one of the oldest and continuously surviving living civilizations on the face of the Earth. Therefore, it is only natural that several time-keeping strategies would have evovled in this part of the world over centuries, if not millenia. But unfortunately, a study tracing the development of various such ideas in an unbiased and scientific manner is lacking in post-Independence (1947 CE) India. Even some of the simpler aspects in daily use are also not taught in schools under the pretext of secularism. It is high-time that this lacuna be corrected and the new National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 has come at this opportune moment. In this context, here is a small effort to uncover some of the basic aspects of time-keeping techniques practiced in the Indian sub-continent from a very ancient time. 

## Background 
In the wake of the rapid technological progress since the industrial revolution, some of the techniques adopted in ancient civilizations have become obsolete and many others are relegated to oblivion. However, the time-keeping based on the movement of celestial objects still continues to be in vogue in the Indian sub-
continent, at least for religious purposes. Just after India’s independence from the British, there was an effort to study the Indian Calendar Systems and constitute an Indian National Calendar. Although such a calendar was proposed, it did not find acceptance either for religious purposes nor for
the affairs of the state. Hence, seven decades later we have fallen back on the Gregorian calendar for official purposes and the various traditional pañcāṅga-s for religious purposes. There are some differences in the various pañcāṅga-s published from different places today, probably because of the method of computation and models (and their underlying parameters) used. Here, we set out to understand the basic scientific principles behind a pañcāṅga and document differences observed between different pañcāṅga-s.

## Terminologies
As mentioned earlier, the motion of celestial bodies was a very important aspect of time-keeping. As per today's understanding, the oldest surviving literature is the Rigveda, which was most likely composed by people inhabiting today's Punjab and Haryana i.e., the banks of Sindhu-Sarasvati, otherwise known as the Sapta-sindhu (land of seven rivers). It is to be kept at the back of our mind that the earliest record of Indian civilization is therefore more temperate (latitude of about 30 degree North) than tropical.

The two celestial bodies nobody can miss are the Sun and the Moon. So, we start from there. Today, we know that the Earth revolves around the Sun. But an observer stationed on the Earth would not easily be able to tell whether the Earth revolves around the Sun or otherwise, based on naked-eye observations alone. All ancient civilizations and likewise our ancients made all their observations from the Earth, and so our discussion here also will talk from the same perspective. Since the Sun is seen to rise in the East and set in the West; and also move with respect to the background stars, our ancients naturally
took the Sun to be a moving celestial object (at least initially). 

### Motion of the Sun
The time ‘taken’ by the Sun to complete one revolution around the Earth is called an
year. Perhaps in the earliest olden days, this was called a yuga. Even today, we celebrate the beginning of a new year as yugādi. But the more popular name for the time taken by the Sun to complete one revolution around the Earth is समा or संवत्सर. One may recall the famous श्लोक from रामायणम् here "मा निषाद प्रतिष्ठां त्वमगमः शाश्वतीः समाः। यत् क्रौञ्चमिथुनादेकम् अवधीः काममोहितम्॥"

Every day, the Sun appears to rise in the East and set in the West. This is due to the rotation of the Earth on its axis (This is mentioned by Āryabhaṭa himself). The axis of rotation of the Earth is titled with respect to the plane of revolution of the Earth by about 23.5 degrees. This gives rise to seasons on the Earth. The plane in which the Sun appears to go round the Earth is called ‘ecliptic’, as shown in red colour in Figure 1. 
|![Ecliptic](./ecliptic.png)|
|:-:| 
|Figure 1. Ecliptic: the path taken by the sun around the Earth.|

The ecliptic makes an angle of 23.5 degrees with the Earth’s equator. As seen in the figure, there are four cardinal points on the ecliptic, namely winter solstice, summer solstice, vernal equinox and autumnal equinox. The vernal and autumnal equinox points lie on the intersection of the ecliptic with the celestial equator. The summer solstice point is the Northern-most point of the ecliptic and the winter solstice point the Southern-most. From the time of winter solstice till the summer solstice, the length of the day increases progressively in the Northern henisphere. Hence, for us in India the period of uttarāyaṇa begins from winter solstice and extends till summer solstice. Similarly, from the time of summer solstice till winter solstice, the length of the day descreases progressively in the
Northern hemisphere. Hence, we say dakṣiṇāyana begins from summer solstice and extendstill winter solstice. Therefore, one year is divided into two ayanas – uttarāyaṇa and dakṣiṇāyana. 

Uttarāyaṇa said to be the day of the devas and dakṣiṇāyana is said to be the night of the devas. Notice that in the Northern hemisphere, summer solstice has the longest duration of day while winter solstice has the shortest duration of day. The length of day and night will be exactly equal on the days of the equinox. The
equinoxes are sometimes called viṣuvat in Indian languages, sometimes viṣuvat may be loosely used for solstices too. The word viṣuvat comes the root viṣḷ, meaning ‘to spread’. Hence, viṣu is sometimes taken as the center out of which something can spread. If an year is reckoned from winter solstice to winter solstice, then the center of the year will fall on summer solstice, which was called viṣuvat in ancient times. Later on, viṣuvat came to be associated with the center of each ayana, and therefore became associated with the equinoxes. Now, the tropical year is defined as the time between two successive vernals equinoxes or between two successive winter solstice points. Note that the average length of the tropical year is 365.2425 days. The seasons on Earth are determined by this tropical year.

Parāśaratantra (pre-siddhāntic-astronomy) divides the two ayanas into 3 ṛtus (seasons) each, yielding a total of 6 ṛtus; namely śiśira (winter), vasanta (spring), grīṣma (summer), varṣa (rainy), śarad (autumn), hemanta (snowy). However, in the (chāndramāna/sauramāna) calendars in vogue today, the above alignment between the ayanas and ṛtus is not seen. Among the six ṛtus, vasanta, varṣa and śarad are most beautiful. Hence, the names of these seasons are sometimes used interchangably with the year itself. For example, varṣa is also used to mean an year. Similarly, the age of a person (in years) could be said by stating that he has seen so many vasantas or so many śarads. Vasanta is the time when colourful leaves and flowers bloom and śarad is the time when the sky is clear of clouds and the Moon and stars are clearly visible. Hence, the name/expression śarat-chandra is used to indicate that the (full) Moon is clearly visible without any obstructions. The Mahānārāyaṇa-Upaniṣad says “jīvema śaradaḥ śatam, nandāma śaradaḥ śatam, modāma śaradaḥ śatam…” (Let us live for a hundred śarads, happily, with enjoyments, etc.). In the Puruṣasūkta, creation itself is described in terms of a yajña where Vasanta is likened to the ghee, grīṣma to fuel and śarad to oblations. During the rainy season (varṣa-ṛtu), it was rather difficult to travel in the olden days. Hence, people used to take up the chāturmāsya-vrata of staying in a place and undertake learning and contemplation under the guidance of mahātmas who would be following a similar lifestyle.

### Motion of the Moon
The Moon takes about 27.3 days on average to complete one revolution around the Earth. Our ancients knew that this period was between 27 and 28 days. Therefore, 27 (or 28)
patterns or groups of bright stars were identified in the night sky to keep track of the movement of the Moon. These came to be known as nakṣatras. Note that nakṣatra is a
technical term used for patterns of stars, and therefore nakṣatra is not to be confused for an individual star. For example, Kṛttikā-nakṣatra has six prominent constituent stars which appear in the pattern of a machete. A map of the nakṣatra-s reconstructed with the help of Parāśaratantra is shown in Figure 2. The names of the nakṣatras starting from the topmost going anti-clockwise are as follows: कृत्तिका, रोहिणी, मृगशिरा, आर्द्रा, पुनर्वासू, पुष्य, आश्लेष, मघा, पूर्वफल्गुणी, उत्तरफल्गुणी, हस्त, चित्रा, स्वाती, विशाखा, अनुराधा, ज्येष्ठा, मूला, पूरवाषाढा, उत्तराषाढा, श्रवण, धनिष्ठा, शतभिषा, पूर्वप्रोष्ठपदा (पूर्वभाद्रपदा), उत्तरप्रोषठपदा (उत्तरभाद्रपदा), रेवती, अश्विनी, भरणी.

|Figure 2. The path taken by the Moon is divided into 27 nakṣatra-s.|

Bhagavān Śrī Kṛṣṇa was born in the Rohiṇī nakṣatra means that the Moon was in in vicinity of Rohiṇī-nakṣatra (called occulatation in technical terminology). In the vibhūtiyoga of Bhagavad-Gītā, where Bhagavān Śrī Kṛṣṇa identifies Himself with the prominent one in every group; there He identifies Himself with Chandra among the group of nakṣatras (“nakṣatrāṇāmaham śaśī”). One tradition identified 27 nakṣatras while another identified 28 nakṣatras. Over time, when the period was found to be closer to 27 days rather than 28 days, one nakṣatra was dropped. This concept came to be codified in the Taittirīya Saṁhitā of Yajurveda as follows: Dakṣa Prajāpati had 28 daughters whom he gave in marriage to Chandra and asked him to care for all the 28 equally. But as time went by, Chandra was seen to spend more time with Rohiṇī. Angered by this, Dakṣa cursed Chandra to undergo kṣaya or to wane. When Chandra was about to be fully gone, he requested Dakṣa for pardon, and then Dakṣa asked Chandra to request Sūrya for help.

In the most ancient times, the region assigned to each nakṣatra was not constained to be mathematically equal, but was meant to be recognized easily by naked eye observations due to their patterns. However, later on, when the influence of mathematics on astronomy increased, each nakṣatra came to be associated with equally divided sectors, each with an angle of 13º20’ (360º divided into 27 segments yields 13º20’). Also, nakṣatra stands for a unit of time. It can be defined as the time taken by the Moon to cover an angle of 13º20’ in its revolution around the Earth. However, the angular velocity of the Moon is not constant; hence the Moon may cover one sector faster than another.

It is observed that during one year, we get to see 12 new moons (amāvāsya). In Sanskrit, amā means ‘near’ (also in amātya for minister). So, here the Sun and Moon are together, therefore the light reflected by the Moon does not reach the Earth. Hence we see the new moon, as shown in Figure 3. After about 27.3 days, the Moon returns to this starting reference position. But in this time, the Sun would also have moved forward by about 27º (since the Sun covers 360º in about 365 days or roughly 1º per day). Since the Moon covers about 13º20’ in a day, the Moon will take two more days to “catch up” with the Sun. Hence, the average duration between two amāvāsya is about 29.5 days. Our ancients rounded this up to 30 and defined 30 tithis to make up one month or māsa. Notice that even in English, the word month comes from ‘Moon’ itself. This māsa can be divided into two halves comprising of 15 tithis each; one in which the Moon waxes and the other in which it wanes; called śukla-pakṣa and kṛṣṇa-pakṣa. Śukla-pakṣa is said to be the day for the pitṛs and kṛṣṇa-pakṣa their night. Notice that the full moon is seen when the Sun and the Moon are diametrically opposite. Figure 3 shows the different phases of the Moon with the position of the Sun to be fixed on the right side.
|![Naksatra-mala](./moon_phases.png)|
|:-:| 
|Figure 3. Phases of the Moon are dependent on the position of the Moon relative to the Sun.|

Since 30 tithis are identified for one month, a tithi may be defined as the time taken by the Moon to lead the Sun by 12º (since 12 X 30 = 360). As mentioned earlier, the angular velocities of the Sun and the Moon are not uniform. Hence, the exact duration of some tithis may be smaller than others. For the sake of convenience, in some sampradāyas, the tithi at the time of Sunrise is taken as the tithi for the whole day. If a particular tithi begins before Sunrise on a given day and ends after Sunrise on the next day, then the said tithi would be prevalent for two (civil) days. For example, if ekādaśī begins at 5AM on a day and ends at 8AM the next day, two days will be marked as ekādaśī in the said method. A call has to be taken by those people who are undertaking upavāsa. Suppose chaturthī begins at 3PM on a given day and ends at 5AM next day, then in the said method, no day will be marked as chaturthī. If a certain festival or ceremony is to be done on chaturthī, again a call has to be taken as to when to
perform the said ritual/s. Note that tithi keeps track of the difference in the angles made by the Sun and the Moon. To provide redundancy for error correction, yoga is defined to keep track of the sum of the celestial longitudes of by the Sun and the Moon. 27 yogas are identified, similar to nakṣatras. Karaṇa is another unit of time defined as one half of a tithi (probably analogous to day and night). 11 Karaṇas are identified, four of which are fixed and seven of which vary as the tithis of a māsa proceed.

### Adhikamāsa 
We saw that the average duration between two new moons was 29.5 days. Taking 12 lunar months for a
year, we get 354 days. But in a tropical solar year, there are 365.2425 days. Hence, there are about 11 days
more in the Solar year as compared to 12 lunar months. In other words, if 12 lunar months is taken as one
year; then there is an error of about 11 days. This error builds over time and in 2.5 years it becomes about
28 days; when a full lunar month can be added for compensation. Hence, in every 5 years, 2 extra months
known as intercalary months or adhikamāsa is added to synchronize the motions of the Sun and the Moon.
That is, in 5 solar years, there will be 62 lunar months.
In the earliest times, this 5 year period came to known as a yuga since the motions of the Sun and
the Moon were approximately synchronized. Interestingly, a periodicity of 5-6 years is also found in the rainfall
data [[1]](#1). This adhikamāsa can be avoided if the month can be defined based on the Sun itself. This
came to be known as the Sauramāna calendar. Here the ecliptic is divided into 12 equal parts, each known
as a rāśi such as Meṣa (Airies), Vṛṣabha (Taurus), Mithuna (Gemini) etc. till Mīna (Pisces). The event
that the Sun enters a particular rāśi is called saṅkramaṇa or saṅkrānti. A month may be then defined as
one saṅkrānti/saṅkramaṇa to the next. For example, the first month Meṣa begins when the Sun enters the
Meṣa-rāśi and ends when the Sun enters Vṛṣabha-rāśi. In this reckoning, the duration of an year will be
20 minutes longer than the tropical year. Hence, in about 72 years, the event of Meṣa-saṅkrānti will slip
one day forward according to the Gregorian calendar. For example, suppose in 2000 CE, Meṣa-saṅkrānti
happened on 14th April exactly at Sunrise (6AM). Then in 2072 CE, Meṣa-saṅkrānti will happen on 15th
April around Sunrise. The Sauramāna calendar is used in Bengal, Orissa, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Coastal
Parts of Karnataka. The Cāndramāna calendar is used in majority of Karnataka, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh,
Uttar Pradesh, Bihar etc.

### Sidereal year
Earlier, we saw how the motion of the Moon was tracked with the help of nakṣatras. These nakṣatras could
be used to track the movement of the Sun too. The time interval between two events of the Sun entering,
say, Aśvinī nakṣatra is defined as a siderial year or bhagaṇa (bha = nakṣatra) in Sanskrit. The average
siderial year is 365.2563 days. The siderial year on an average is 20 minutes longer than the tropical year
due to precession of the equinoxes. This difference of 20 minutes will grow to one day (24 hours) in about
72 years. With this rule of thumb, we can estimate the number of years ago when Uttarāyaṇa (Dec 21)
coincided with Makara-saṅkramaṇa (Jan 15). Since there is a gap of about 25 days, it means this alignment
was there (25 × 72 =) 1800 years ago.
Winter solstice or the beginning of Uttarāyaṇa usually occurs around December 21st which is pretty
much fixed, simply because the Gregorian calendar was calibrated to the tropical year by a Papal Bull "Inter gravissimas" dated 24 February 1582 CE by Pope Gregory XIII. We know that about two
thousand years ago, Makara-saṅkrānti and Uttarāyaṇa had coincided; which means then Makara-saṅkrānti
was happening around December 21st. However, the beginning of Uttarāyaṇa is when the Sun starts moving
Northwards, which is observed and celebrated in all ancient cultures. This event is much more significant
than the Sun entering Makara-rāśi. Therefore, some people opine that Uttarāyaṇa must be celebrated at the
right time and not continue to use Makara-saṅkrānti as a proxy for Uttarāyaṇa.

### The Seven-day week
Although there are references to saptāha in the context of the Aśvamedha-yāga in the Yajurveda, the concept of a seven-day week (named on the grahas visible to the naked eye) is not seen in the Rāmāyaṇa, Mahābhārata or in any of Kālidāsa’s works. Hence, the popular opinion among scholars is that the the seven-day week came into being much later, probably around the 5th century CE. Also, note that the week or weekday is not directly related to an astronomical event unlike nakṣatra or tithi discussed above.

The celestial objects, namely, Ravi (Sun), Candra (Moon), Budha (Mercury), Śukra (Venus), Kuja (Mars), Guru (Jupiter) and Śani (Saturn) appear to move with respect to the background stars. In the Greek tradition, these ‘moving’ celestial objects came to be known as ‘planets’ which means ‘wanderers’. However, in the Indian tradition, which is arguably much older than the Greek, the ‘wandering’ objects were said to ‘hold’ different stars during their motion; and  therefore came to be known as tārāgrahas (tārāḥ gṛṇhāti
iti tārāgrahaḥ). Over time, the name tārāgraha was shortened to graha for brevity. Again, it is to be noted that tārāgraha or graha is a technical term and is not to be confused with today’s understanding of planets of the solar system which orbit the Sun.

Each day of the week came to be named after the grahas listed above according to the following rule:
The grahas are first arranged in increasing order of their speeds as seen from the Earth: Śani (Saturn, 30 years), Guru (Jupiter, 12 years), Kuja (Mars, 2 years), Ravi (Sun, 1 year), Śukra (Venus, 225 days), Budha (Mercury, 88 days) and Candra (Moon, 27.3 days). Each of the seven grahas are assigned one hour out of the 24 hours per day. The graha which gets assigned to the first hour of a particular day, lends its name to that particular day. Since 24 leaves a remainder of 3 upon division by 7; it is easy to see that Ravivāra (Sunday) is followed by Somavāra (Monday) and that Budhavāra (Wednesday) is followed by Guruvāra (Thursday) etc.

#### Imagery of Śrī Krishna’s birth
It was mentioned earlier that Uttarāyaṇa is day for devas and Dakṣiṇāyana is night. Hence, one human year (about 360 days) is one day (like 24 hours) for the devas. Similarly, śukla-pakṣa and kṛṣṇa-pakṣa (the bright fortnight and the dark fortnight) are day and night respectively for the pitṛs. Hence, one human month is one day for the pitṛs.

Bhagavān Śrī Kṛṣṇa was born on Śrāvaṇa-māsa, Kṛṣṇa-pakṣa aṣṭamī night in the Rohiṇī nakṣatra. Śrāvaṇa falls in the rainy season and in Dakṣiṇāyana. Hence, Śrī Krishna’s birth happens when it is night
for the devas, night for the pitṛs and night for the ṛṣis (humans) too. In addition, His birth happens in jail when His own uncle is waiting to kill him as soon as He takes birth. It is also raining heavily at the time, therefore making it difficult to even light a fire using a log of wood or any other fuel. Having being born in
such a hopelessly gloomy and dark situation, He goes on to show light to the entire world; enduring all what life throws at Him with a rise smile on His face without complaints about anything or anyone. Śrī Krishna’s life and the said imagery is a source of hope and inspiration to humanity when faced with difficult and trying
situations.
